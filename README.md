# Hargonize

The name probably needs work.

This is a tool that lets you compare previous version of a website with a locally cached copy. I'm working on making it functional with multiple URLs and something you can just set up as a cron job.

Okay so, it's kind of functional. 

I'm kind of upset how javascript treats its HTML because it __always__ shows updated when I'm reading a javascript generated HTML file. I'm wondering if I can remedy this by using an HTML/CSS parser to convert the generated CSS or HTML into default variable names and check it that way? I'm not sure how to remedy this yet but at least it's functional for static websites...
